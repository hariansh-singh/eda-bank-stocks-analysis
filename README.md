# Stock Price Analysis

In this data project, we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. Please note that this project is intended for practicing visualization and pandas skills, and should not be considered as robust financial analysis or financial advice.

## Objective

We will analyze the stock prices of various banks from the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007-2008 until early 2016. The data will be obtained from Yahoo Finance.

## Steps

To obtain the stock data for each bank, we will follow these steps:
